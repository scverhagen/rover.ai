# Introduction 
I started this project to determine if the Raspberry Pi is powerful enough to control a basic self-driving (remote controlled) car.  It is--and it works!  In the near future, I plan to use this platform as an aid in training middle and high school kids about electronics, software engineering and machine learning.
